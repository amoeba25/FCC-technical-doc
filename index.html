            <p> Say you go on a nice vacation and take a lot of pictures on your phone. You now want to access these images on 
                your computer to edit them and your father also wants to see them. One way is to move each image using your USB 
                transfer to your computer and your dad's phone and keep doing that for every device you want to use but a more 
                sensible approach would be to upload them onto google drive where everyone can view those pictures just by the click
                of a link and add pictures from their own phone. </p>
            <p>The same thing could be applied to code but in this case your google drive is Github where you can upload your code
                and other memebers from your team could either change, download or add their own code to the project. Git is just 
                the software which helps you complete the procedure and keep track of everything.  </p>
            </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Setting_things_up">
            <header> Setting things up </header>
            <p> First task is to headover to the Github website and make an account. Next step is install git from <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">here</a>. 
                We will first start by working on the Github site. The first thing to do is to create a repository from the main page. 
                <ul>
                    <li> What is a repository?</li>
                    <li> A repository is esentially a folder in Github in which
                    your project lives. We cam intialise it with a Readme which
                    esentially gives a breif description about your project
                    </li>
                    <li> This is what it initially looks like </li>
                    <li><img src="https://amoeba25.github.io/FCC-technical-doc/images/repo-setup.PNG" class="main-images"> </li>
                </ul>
            <p>Now once we have made a repo we can start adding our files to it. </p>
            </p>
            <p class="extra-text">Protip - if you're a student you can sign up for Github github student developer pack using your 
                college email id. You'll get access to Github Pro for free along with discounted access to different 
                tools. 
            </p>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Commits">
            <header> Commits </header>
            <p> Now to add files we click on 'add files' button and add the file. After editing the file, we can go ahead
                and 'commit' the file to the repository. </p>
            <ul>
                <li> What does commiting a file mean? </li>
                <li> <img src="https://amoeba25.github.io/FCC-technical-doc/images/commit.PNG" class="main-images"> </li>
                <li> Commiting a file in simple terms means saving (although saving and commiting could mean different things
                    as we will later see) any changes we make. These changes could be adding or removing files and also editing the pre-exisiting 
                    files. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If we are collaborating on a project then it's a good practice to describe our commits well before making them for 
                the other people working on the repo. </p>
            <img src="https://amoeba25.github.io/FCC-technical-doc/images/commit-hist.PNG" class="main-images"> 
            <p> Each commit has an associated hash code as we can see from the picture. We will talk about it's significane 
                in the next section. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Branches">
            <header> Branches </header>
            <p> A main advantage of using Github is source control. This means we can create different isntances of the same
                project, make changes to the project and still revert back to the orginal project if we aren't happy with the changes. 
                This is what makes Github a powerful tool for collaboration. We do this by usng branches. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> What is branching? </li>
                    <li> Branching is creating another instance of the same repo. We have been working only on the main branch until now
                        Whenever we hit commit, by default we commit the changes to the main branch. 
                    </li>
                </ul> 
            <img src="https://amoeba25.github.io/FCC-technical-doc/images/create-branch.PNG" class="main-images"> 
            <p> We go create a new branch user and after selecting that branch we make changes to our files </p>
            <p> On making the changes we 'commit' the changes to our user branch </p>
            <img src="https://amoeba25.github.io/FCC-technical-doc/images/branch-commit.PNG" class="main-images">
            <p> This entails that the changes that we made are only limited to the user branch. If we switch to 
                our main branch we notice the changes aren't reflected in it. If the person you are collaborating with
                creates a seprate branch and changes the contents but not to your liking then you could just reject those 
                changes and your original code remains unaffected.</p>
        </section> 
        <section class="main-section" id="Merge">
            <header> Merge </header>
            <p> Now we have made some changes to the user branch and we like them enough and want to include them in our main branch.
                We do that by sending a pull request and merging both the branches </p>
            <ul> 
                <li> What is a pull request? </li>
                <li> A pull request is esentially requesting the owner of the repo to look into the changes we have 
                    made on our user branch and accept those. It's called a 'pull' request as the user will pull the changes 
                    from our branch.
                </li> 
            </ul>
            <img src="https://amoeba25.github.io/FCC-technical-doc/images/cmp-pull.PNG" class="main-images">
            <p> We click the compare and pull here. We also notice how Github notifies us that the user branch 
                is one commit ahead of the main branch. 
            </p>
            <img src="https://amoeba25.github.io/FCC-technical-doc/images/pull-req.PNG" class="main-images">
            <p> We can leave any comments associated with the pull requests and then hit create a pull request. 
                Github then compares both our branches and checks to see if there are any conflicts to them(we changed 
                the same line on the same doc using 2 different branches). If there are no conflicts we could 
                merge both the branches together. </p>
            <ul>
                <li> What is merging? </li>
                <li> Once we have made all the changes in our current working branch, we would want to 
                    make the same changes to our main branch. We can esentially 'merge' both the branches so 
                    that the changes in user branch are reflected in the main branch and we can continue working 
                    on the changed project.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="https://amoeba25.github.io/FCC-technical-doc/images/merge.PNG" class="main-images"> 
            <p> We click the merge pull request here and we have merged the branches. If we check out the main branch
                now we can see that the changes are reflected
            </p> 
            <p> If we want to look at a tree diagram we could go to 'Insights>Network' and notice how the user branch 
                was created,changed and then merged back to the main branch</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Forking">
            <header> Forking </header>
            <p> Say we have a public repo- bootstrap project. Now me as a github user wants to make changes to the repo but I might
                mess something up if I was to work on the orginal project. What I could do is 'fork' the repo. It means creating
                another instance of sort of the repo which would sit on my account and I could make changes to it. We will have 
                an exact replica of the entire github repo along with it's whole history. Once the changes have been made, I could 
                send a pull request to the owner of the repo and request the changes. If my request gets approved, the changes will now 
                be a part of the bootstrap project. This makes Github a great tool to partcipate in open-source communities and have
                user added features. </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Issues">
            <header> Issues </header>
            <p> If we are working on a public project, chances are we might run into some bug that the developer had not thought
                of. We can notify the owner of the project by filling an issue </p>
            <ul> 
                <li> What are issues? </li>
                <li> Issues are in simple terms a complain forum where we can comment about 
                    any bugs that we have faced using the product. An issue remains open unti it is deemed to be fixed by either
                    devloper or the person who complained about it.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="https://amoeba25.github.io/FCC-technical-doc/images/issue-submit.PNG" class="main-images">
            <p> We can refer to a commit using it's hashcode and file an issue if we aren't happy
                with the commit. We can even use markdown and add any screenshots or code snippets we 
                might want to use
            </p>
            <img src="https://amoeba25.github.io/FCC-technical-doc/images/issue-res.PNG"> 
            <p> The owner can then put any comments once the issue is solved and close the issue. </p>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Git_startup">
            <header> Git startup </header>
            <p> We learned how to use Github to upload our code to the servers and access it using the Github website but what if 
                we wanted to download a repo from a project and work on it locally on our computer? Or we have a folder on your laptop that 
                we want to upload to our Github account as a repository. This is where using Git from our command line comes in. </p>
            <p> To start off we could do use help command to get a list of different commands we can use with git </p>
            <code> D:\Soham\temp>git help</code>
            <p> We then need to configure our system to be connected with our github profile and email.</p>
            <code>  D:\Soham\temp>git config --global user.name "amoeba25" 
  D:\Soham\temp>git config --global user.email "amoeba@gmail.com" </code>
            <p> Once we have configured our system, we are ready to use Git. Now change the working
                directory to the one we want to work on. We can now use either of the two methods to 
                start using Git:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. The clone method</li>
                <li>2. The init method</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Clone_method">
            <header> Clone method </header>
            <p> In this method we make our repository on the Github website like we did above,download it
                and then work on it locally.To start off, we need to clone the repository </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is cloning? </li>
                    <li>Cloning in simple terms is just downloading the repository from the Github website. 
                        It could be any repo we want to use locally on our computer. </li>
                </ul>
            <img src="https://amoeba25.github.io/FCC-technical-doc/images/clone-url.PNG" class="main-images"> 
            <p> We copy this url and paste it in our working directory as such </p>
            <code> D:\Soham\temp>git clone https://github.com/amoeba25/FCC-git-project.git </code>
            <p> Once the repo has been download we can start adding files to folder or make changes
                to the existing files. Here we make some changes to our about.html file and save it. 
                This is why I mentioned save and commit aren't the same thing. On our machine the file 
                has been saved but we need to commit this file to main branch. We modify and save 'about.html' 
                We then use the status command to get the status of the directory </p>
            <code> D:\Soham\temp\FCC-git-project>git status
 On branch main
 Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
                
 Changes not staged for commit:
 (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
 (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
  modified:   about.html
                
 no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a") </code> 
            <p> It's noticeable here how the file has been changed and saved bu we haven't commited it yet. To commit this we will
            have to add it to staging are </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is a staging area? </li>
                    <li>If we have 10 files in our repo and we make changes to all of them. We want to only
                commit 5 of these files. To achieve this we have a 'staging area'. We only add files 
                we want to commit to this staging area. After adding the files we can commit the changes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Adding the 'about.html', we can get it's status and notice it's added to the 
                staging area
            </p>
            <code>D:\Soham\temp\FCC-git-project>git add about.html

D:\Soham\temp\FCC-git-project>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
(use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
modified:   about.html </code>
            <p> Once these have been staged, we can finally commit these files with 
                a message 
            </p>
            <code>D:\Soham\temp\FCC-git-project>git commit -m"modified about.html locally"</code>
            <p>Now these changes have been commited to the main branch. The last thing to do is push them to 
               our github repo online. Remember we cloned the repo to our local device. The commits have been
                made on our local device instance but the changes we make on our local device need to be pushed 
                to our orginal online repo. 
            </p>
            <p> Before pushing we need to understand that we have a remote repository in Git</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is a remote? </li>
                <li> A remote is a common repo that all team members can use to exchange their changes.Such a remote
                    is stored on a hosting website which is Github in our case. This is in contrast to the local instance
                    of the repo that is on our device </li>
            </ul>
            <p> If we input command 'remote' we can get the repos associated with our file </p>
            <code> D:\Soham\temp\FCC-git-project>git remote
 origin</code> 
            <p> This 'origin' points to our repo. We need to reference it to push our changes to our main branch. We do this by </p>
            <code>D:\Soham\temp\FCC-git-project>git push origin main</code>
            <p> Now finally if we head over to Github and check our repo online, we can notice that the changes have been made.</p>
        </section>


        <section class="main-section" id="Init_method">
            <header> Init method </header>
            <p> If instead of making the repo on Github and cloning it, we want to make one our local computer
                we can use the init method. Make a director type </p>
            <code>D:\Soham\temp\init-project>git init
Initialized empty Git repository in D:/Soham/temp/init-project/.git/</code>
            <p> The porblem with this is we wont have a remote attached to this repo. So if we input 
                remote command then it's not going to show anything. We need to add that remote ourselves. 
            </p>
            <p>First step to do that would be to add make an empty repository using Github. Intialising it without a Readme
                will give us this. We copy the url. 
            </p>
            <img src="https://amoeba25.github.io/FCC-technical-doc/images/remote.PNG" class="main-images">
            <p> After getting the url of the Repo we can just add a remote to it</p>
            <code> D:\Soham\temp\init-project>git remote add origin https://github.com/amoeba25/init-project.git </code>
            <p> Now on inputing 'git remote', it returns origin and so it's linked to our github repo. We can now edit,add or delete 
                files and follow the same steps of add,commit and push like we did for the clone method.</p>

            <header>Github pages </header>
            
            <p> A relatively unkown feature on Github is it allows you to host your websites, free of cost. These are known as 
                Github pages and its easy to set one up </p>
            <p> The first step to do is to make a new branch called 'gh-pages'. This helps Github identify we are going to be 
                using Github pages. 
            </p>
            <p> Next step is to go to 'Settings>Branches' and change the default branch from main to gh-pages</p>

            <p> And we're done! We can then go to 'Settings>options' and scroll down to find the link where our 
                repo is hosted. 
            </p>
            <img src="https://amoeba25.github.io/FCC-technical-doc/images/final.PNG" class="main-images"> 
            <p>We can then use this url to access different pages of our repo. We could also delete the main branch completly
                so as to not accidemtally use it.
            </p>
            <p>Thus we can see how powerful Github is for collaboarting easily with people and acting as a source control system.
